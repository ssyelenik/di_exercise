# Conditions

Conditional statements are an universal programming paradigm to take certain actions based on data comparison. Itâ€™s our way of communicating to the computer, if something is true then perform such action, otherwise perform an other action.

###### See the official documentation here

#### Conditions are expressions that compare two elements.

Python support the following logical conditions:

- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b
